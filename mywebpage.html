<p> This is a webpage documenting my current PC build I am working on :). Most parts have been ordered and it will be completed soon!
<br>I started planning in September of last year, and started making purchases in October. <br>I am now nearly done with it in March of 2025,
and it should be fully built by April! </p>

<h3> My current PC </h3>

<p> I've always been into PC gaming, but only now recently got into the more technical side and started to learn more about PC building.
<br>My current computer is sadly starting to show its age; being 5 years old and not using an SSD, it struggles with most modern games and programs.
<br>Because I've decided to change my career path in life from psychology to programming/illustrator, I decided I would use this as an excuse to
finally build a new computer! <p>

<p> Another reason I wanted to upgrade my PC is because a new game in my favorite series was announced, Monster Hunter! <br>Though with my current
PC being from when the last game was released, I knew it was time to get something new. While I planned to upgrade shortly after the announcment
in September, <br>I wasn't too comfortable with the idea of building PCs and thought of having my more technical friends build one for me, while 
I supplied the parts.

<p> What made me deiced to fully commit to building a PC was something more personal however. <br>During my first semester of college, I had a career crisis
and decided that my current major of Psychology wasn't suited for me anymore. <br>Despite having no previous technical knowledge, I decided to switch my 
major to Computer Science, with the hopes of learning how to program <br>and combining this with my love of art to become a Game Designer!</p>

<p> Alongside this build, I bought a drawing tablet to help me start learning digital drawing! <br>I chose the Huion 13 tablet because it was a nice beginner
budget option, but still had the features I wanted from a tablet. </p>
